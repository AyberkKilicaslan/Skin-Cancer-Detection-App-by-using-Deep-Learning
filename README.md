Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning \n
Melanoma is a cancer caused by pigment-containing cells called melanocytes. It is one of the most dangerous cancers. Melanoma cancer causes nearly 55,000 deaths per year, accounting for 0.7 percent of all cancer deaths.. On the other hand, recently, medical diagnostic systems with artificial intelligence support have become quite widespread. The aim of this project is to develop a mobile phone application that will help in the early diagnosis of melanoma skin cancer with the help of deep neural network models.
In the project, 4000 melanoma cancer and 4000 benign labeled skin lesion images selected from the dataset of the ISIC 2017 competition were used. After the images were passed through preprocessing processes, they were used in the training of deep neural networks. The results of different deep learning models have been compared with each other. Comparisons have been made both in terms of accuracy rates and their applicability to mobile phones. As a result of the comparisons made, the most suitable model has been determined and it has been brought to the format to be used in mobile applications.
